# Purpose
I've built this portfolio to briefly introduce myself and show you my technical abilities as a software engineer (SWE). The index page serves as a short and sweet introduction, whereas the projects page is a neat display of all of the software projects I've worked on. Lastly, the contact page is where you can follow up with me or leave feedback.

If you'd like the long and sweet introduction, then please keep reading below. Otherwise feel free to open up my portfolio and begin browsing through my software projects.
  


  
# About Me
## Passion
I love helping people. This calling is what wakes me up in the morning and is on my mind every night as I lie down to sleep. I constantly seek out ways to help others achieve their goals. I'm currently supporting my fiance as she tries to land her dream job at Disney, and encouraging my best friend of 20 years to learn how to code alongside me. I used to tutor friends free of charge for classes I had already taken during my college years. This is a resounding theme in my life, and I'd love to share it with you.

## Hobbies
I take fitness very seriously. I'm usually in the gym at least an hour a day. A bit of contrast here, but I'm also a big foodie as well. I spend the largest portion of my discretionary income going out to grab a meal with family and friends. My fiance loves the movies, so we get the best of both worlds by frequenting Alamo Drafthouse. I game a fair amount, but have found that I generally enjoy more productive outlets as I've gotten older. However, if you like video games then I can surely engage you in scintillating conversation on the matter. 

## Experience
Reminiscing on college days, I spent my time earning two bachelor's degrees: one for Finance, the other for Physical Therapy. My favorite moments were presenting our school's endowment strategy to the President of the University, and interning at geriatric facilities under a good family friend in Houston.

After graduation I moved on to the tech world. Austin has a very lively tech scene and lots of opportunities for folks coming out of college. We had a family friend hiring for temporary positions for Indeed. I followed that opportunity and earned a full time position with an extremely exciting group - Indeed Assessments. This team is the only external acquisition Indeed has ever made. I was hire number 22 for the team, and we grew to 70+ employees in two years. We hadn't published our first assessment when I began, and now we're live in 22 countries and serving ~100 million jobseekers each year. 

I was hired as a "data analyst" but ended up in an operations role upkeeping our content management system. This is a very high stress job that requires indefatigable attention to detail day in and day out. I maintain my responsibilities in that role, but wanted the chance to exhibit my analytical skills for the team. I taught myself Python and SQL so that I could begin querying Indeeds database and building reports for high level managers. This skill opened another door where I've been able to work closely with our product manager, lead data scientist, and recently our VP of product. 

After wrapping my mind around the fundamentals of analytics and reporting I started looking for a way to drive more impact and help more jobseekers get jobs with Indeed. I enrolled in a full stack development bootcamp to build my technical skills to a new level. I'm looking forward to working as a SWE so that I can directly build tools and features that will help my users in any/every capacity. 

If you made it through all of that, thank you for reading! Feel free to contact me any time to chat or ask questions.

Cheers,
Jacob
